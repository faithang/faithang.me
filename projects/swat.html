            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>After completing my second year of college, I did a summer internship at <a href="https://swatmobility.com" target="_blank">SWAT</a>, a mobility company offering on-demand bus services in Singapore, Australia, London and more. For three months, I wore the hats of Product Manager, UX Designer and Graphic Designer as part of the Product Team. This allowed me to work closely with both the business-operations team and developer team, often having to mediate a balance between the two parties.</p>

            <p>In particular, I was heavily involved in two features of the bus service app: bus interchange stops and wheelchair accessibility requests. This gave me the chance to develop my project management skills by holding meetings, setting deadlines and managing requests and expectations from various teams and stakeholders.</p>
            
            <h1>User Journey Mapping</h1>
            <p>I was involved in the user journey mapping process of several features, namely corporate season passes, bus interchange stops and wheelchair accessibility requests. The journey mapping exercises honed my ability to put myself in the shoes of the user, and identify pain points and opportunities to design for a good user experience.</p>
            

            <h1>User Stories & Wireframing</h1>
            <p>A journey map presents an overview of the user's experience with the service, but smaller, more modular user stories help to guide the wireframing process by breaking down what the user sees and does at each stage.</p>
            <p>The wireframes were done using Sketch and are meant to be rough sketches used to gather quick feedback. Getting input at this early stage meant that I was able to <strong>fail fast and learn faster</strong>.</p>

            <h1>High-Fidelity Mockups</h1>
            <img src="/images/swat/mockups.png" alt="Brainstorming Session">
            <p>
                After the team is happy with the wireframes, we move on to creating high-fidelity mockups in Sketch. These mockups are then handed off to the developer team for implementation. Having these mockups ensure that the screens are properly standardised.
            </p>
            

            <p>
                Campaign solutions contained trends around marketing and public awareness in public transportation spaces. These ideas were based on the frustration people experienced about a lack of awareness on public transportation, especially for those with invisible disabilities.
            </p>

            <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
            <p>Besides dipping my toes into the world of UX Design, I also did some ad-hoc graphic design for the company. This includes some promotional banners for SWAT's Facebook page.</p>
